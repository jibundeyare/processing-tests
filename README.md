# Processing tests

This repository contains small sketches showing how things work with processing.

Note that all sketches are tested and work with Processing 2.2.1.

## donut

This sketch shows how to draw a donut shape using `beginContour()` and `endContour()`.

## draw_mouse_vector

This sketch shows how to use `mouseX`, `mouseY`, `pmouseX` and `pmouseY` to draw a vector of the mouse movements.

## glow_image

This sketch shows how to use `blendMode()` to get a glowing effect when displaying an image.

## image_mask

This sketch shows how to use the mask feature of the PImage class.

## inheritance

This sketch shows how inheritance between a parent and a child class works.

## mypmouse

This sketch shows how to implement a `pmouseX` and `pmouseY` type `myPMouse` vector with a movement threshold.

## on_mouse_event

This sketch shows the order in which mouse events atre triggered.

## opengl_images_display

This sketch shows how to monitor the frame rate when displaying mutilple images using opengl.

## particle_image

This sketch shows how to draw a particle using radial gradients.

## perpendicular

This sketch shows how to draw perpendicular vectors.

## strip

This sketch shows how to draw a strip that follows the mouse.

## translate_draw_shape

This sketch shows how to draw a quad at given coordinates using `translate()`.
